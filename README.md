Topic: Field pea and Chickpea for Sustainable Agricultural Production
Introduction

Farmers donâ€™t tend to grow any crops due to limited resource during drought period. So, open lands can cause erosion and then nutrients will be lost from the field. Therefore, introducing pulse crops (field pea and chickpea) as cover crops in drought period can be more helpful for reducing soil erosion and retaining nutrients as well as fixing nitrogen since they are legumes. In order to determine which pulse crop will yield better, fix more nitrogen, and produce greater biomass, field and chickpea variety are compared with the following objectives:
* Measure the field pea and chickpea biomass production under three irrigation treatments.
* To identify the association between biomass with water use.
* To identify the best crop type (field pea, Chickpea) under same irrigation level.
